# FAQ

## Why you do not post project in Kivy Garden?

Bouquet has a slightly different approach. Each flower in the kivy-garden should be a single widget (or a group of widgets) that do one task. In turn, bouquet provides a wide variety of widgets, which do a lot of different tasks.

## Why Bouquet?

Bouquet is a collection of flowers in a creative arrangement :relaxed:
