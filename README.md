## :interrobang: FAQ

### Why you do not post project at Kivy Garden?

Each flower in the kivy-garden should be a single widget (or a group of widgets)
that do one task. In turn, Bouquet provides a wide range of widgets and tools
that perform many different tasks.

### Why is the library so named?

Bouquet is a collection of flowers in a creative arrangement :blush:
